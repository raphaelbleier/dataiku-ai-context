# Custom variables expansion

Variables expansion is a mechanism in DSS that allows you to use some shared and reusable variables in several parts of the Studio.

You can use variables:

  * Within the code of a code-based recipe

  * Directly in some configuration fields (for example, the path of a dataset)

  * For any field in the configuration of a dataset or a recipe using the **override table** mechanism.




In addition, you can write some custom Python code to automatically update the values of a variable.

Here are some use cases for variables expansion:

  * You have a fairly large flow and several recipes use a global “reference date”, for example the first date for when your data is available, or the last sales date. By putting this global date in a variable, you can update it in all recipes at once.

  * You have two DSS instances, one for development and one for production. You have partitioned datasets, and use the _time range_ dependency to aggregate some data over periods. In development, you want your tests to be fast, so you only aggregate on 7 days, while in prod, you want to aggregate data on 365 days. By using _environment-specific variables_ and an _override_ on the partition dependency, you can achieve this easily.




Using variables in DSS is done in two steps:

  * Defining the variable and its value in the _variables table_

  * Referencing the variable using variable expansion syntax




## Defining variables

Note

You can define variables in Admin tools > Administration, under Settings > Variables

All variables are defined in a JSON object. You are free to use anything as variable name, but we recommend that you stick to “regular” names: A-z, 0-9 and underscore.
    
    
    {
            "logs_preprocessing_excluded_ip": "194.254.61.161",
            "logs_cumulative_aggregate_days": 7
    }
    

## Using variables in the code of a recipe

Variables can be substituted in the code of code-based recipes.

### SQL

Variables are replaced in your code using the `${variable_name}` syntax. For example:
    
    
    SELECT * FROM logs WHERE ip != '${logs_preprocessing_excluded_ip}';
    

### Hive

Variables are replaced in your code using the `${hiveconf:variable_name}` syntax. For example:
    
    
    SELECT * FROM logs WHERE ip != '${hiveconf:logs_preprocessing_excluded_ip}';
    

Note

In Hive, you must not quote the variable expansion for a string expansion

### Python

All variables are available in a python dictionary retrieved by the `dataiku.get_custom_variables()` function

So for example, you can use in your code:
    
    
    import dataiku
    print("I am excluding %s" % (dataiku.get_custom_variables()["logs_preprocessing_excluded_ip"]))
    

Note

This also works in the Python notebook

### R

The value of a variable can be retrieved with the `dkuCustomVariable(name)` function.

So for example, you can use in your code:
    
    
    library(dataiku)
    dkuCustomVariable("logs_preprocessing_excluded_ip")
    

Note

This also works in the R notebook

## Using variables in configuration fields

Some select configuration fields in the DSS interface can perform variables expansion using **${variable}** syntax.

For example, you can use this in the _Path_ field of Filesystem datasets

Note

For the specific case of Filesystem dataset paths, you can also select the prefix of a given Filesystem (or HDFS, S3, …) connection instead of using a variable.

Here, we use this when we want to move the dataset to the analysis of another company. Partitioning could be used here too.

The variables becomes very powerful when combined with dynamically updating the variables through code.

## Using override tables

Some configuration fields can directly use variables expansion, but most can’t, especially when they do not store strings. However, you can _override_ the value of any field in the configuration of a dataset or a recipe through an override table.

For example, we want to use a variable for the number of days aggregated in a Time range dimension.

In the recipe screen, this icon  leads us to the override table:

We see the JSON configuration of our recipe and we can now override any value. Here, we want to override the “fromOffset” value of the first partition dependency. Its “path” in the configuration is : `partitionDeps[0].params.fromOffset`.

So we add an override on this path

When we save and run the recipe, the “2” that was present gets overridden by the current value of the variable.

Warning

When using an override on a variable, the override is not _visible_ in the interface itself. You still always see the non-overridden value (“2” in our case).

The override variables icon, however, turns red when an override is active.

## Using variables in a dashboard

You can use variables with the `${variable}` syntax in the following places:

  * Page title

  * Tile title

  * Text tile content




If the variable is unknown or undefined, the text ${undefined_variable} will be displayed as is.

If you don’t want the variable to be expanded, you can use the `$${variable}` syntax. In this case, ${variable} will be displayed instead of its content.

## Modifying the value of variables

In most cases, you will modify the values of variables from time to time, manually in the administration UI.

There are two other ways to modify the values of variables.

### Environment-specific variables

The variables defined in the administration interface are store in the config/variables.json file.

In addition, if you create in your DSS DataDir a file named `local/variables.json`, the values in this file will override the values defined in the administration interface. This is a great way to have specific dev/prod settings, by copying the “config” folder but not the “local” folder.

### Update variables with code

You can write a snippet of Python code to compute the values of the variables. Your code runs:

  * Manually, when you click on the “Execute update” button in the Administration part

  * Automatically each time you start a job. The values computed by this are used only for this job




One important use case for this is integration with enterprise data catalogs. If you have a centralized service that is able to tell you the location of a given data source (and that location regularly changes), then it’s a good idea to put this location in a variable, and to write some code to update the value of this variable (by doing an API call to your centralized service).

Your code must contain a `get_variables` function that returns a Python dictionary. Each entry of the dictionary will become the value of one variable.

## Using filters

The built-in filters below allow you to apply a special operator on expanded variables to transform them. In the examples, variables are defined as follows:
    
    
    {
            "a": "42",
            "b": "FooBar",
            "c": {
                "foo": [1,2,3]
            },
            "t": 1757942643666
    }
    

### ?

Silently skips rendering if the variable is undefined, preventing errors.

For example: `z=${?z}` will be resolved to `z=`.

### default

Provides a fallback value if the variable is not defined.

For example: `z=${z|default:n/a}` will be resolved to `z=n/a`.

### tolower

Converts the value of the variable to lowercase.

For example: `${b|tolower}` will be resolved to `foobar`.

### toupper

Converts the value of the variable to uppercase.

For example: `${b|toupper}` will be resolved to `FOOBAR`.

### getornull

Safely extracts a value from a JSON object using a specified path (array of keys or indices). If the path exists, it returns the corresponding value. If the path does not exist or is invalid, it returns null, which is eventually converted to an empty string.

For example:

  * `z=${c|getornull:["foo",2]}` will be resolved to `z=3`.

  * `z=${c|getornull:["bar"]}` will be resolved to `z=`.




### tojson

Converts a JSON element to a JSON primitive.

For example: `${c|tojson}` will be resolved to `{"foo":[1,2,3]}`.

### fromjson

Converts a string into a JSON element.

For example: `${c|fromjson}` will be resolved to `{"foo":[1,2,3]}`.

### formatdate

Converts a Unix timestamp (long) into a human-readable date, using the format `yyyy-MM-dd HH:mm:ss.SSS` by default.

For example: `${t|formatdate:yyyy-MM-dd}` will be resolved to `2025-09-15`.

### indent

Applies indentation to variables by prepending with the specified number of whitespace characters.

For example: `x-${a|indent:3}` will be resolved to `x- 42`.
