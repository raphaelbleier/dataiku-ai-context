## Version 9.0.0 - March 1st, 2021

DSS 9.0.0 is a major upgrade to DSS with major new features.

### New features

#### Unified Deployer

The [DSS Deployer](<../../deployment/index.html>) provides a unified environment for fully-managed production deployments of both projects and API services. It allows you to have a central view of all of your production assets, to manage CI/CD pipelines with testing/preproduction/production stages, and is fully API-drivable.

For more details, please see [Production deployments and bundles](<../../deployment/index.html>).

#### Interactive scoring and What-if

Interactive scoring is a simulator that enables any AI builder or consumer to run “what-if” analyses (i.e., qualitative sensibility analyses) to get a better understanding of what impact changing a given feature value has on the prediction by displaying in real time the resulting prediction and the individual prediction explanations.

For more details, please see [Interactive scoring](<../../machine-learning/supervised/interactive-scoring.html>).

#### Dash Webapps

Dash by Plotly is a framework for easily building rich web applications. DSS now includes the ability to write, deploy and manage Dash webapps. Dash joins Flask, Bokeh and Shiny as webapps building frameworks to help data scientists go much further than simple dashboards and provide full interactivity to users.

For more details, please see [Dash web apps](<../../webapps/dash.html>).

#### Fuzzy join recipe

A very frequent data wrangling use case is to join datasets with “almost equal” data. The new “fuzzy join” recipe is dedicated to joins between two datasets when join keys don’t match exactly. It handles inner, left, right and outer fuzzy joins, and handles text, numerical and geographic fuzziness.

For more details, please see [Fuzzy join: joining two datasets](<../../other_recipes/fuzzy-join.html>)

#### Smart Pattern Builder

In Data Preparation, you can now highlight a part of a cell in order to automatically generate suggestions to extract information “similar” to the one you highlighted. You can then add other examples to guide the automated pattern builder of DSS, and choose the pattern that provides you with the best results.

#### Visual ML Diagnostics

ML Diagnostics help you detect common pitfalls while training models, such as overfitting, leakage, insufficient learning and such. It can suggest possible improvements.

For more details, please see [ML Diagnostics](<../../machine-learning/diagnostics.html>)

#### Model assertions

Model assertions streamline and accelerate the model evaluation process, by automatically checking that predictions for specified subpopulations meet certain conditions. You can automatically compare “expected predictions” on segments of your test data with the model’s output. DSS will check that the model’s predictions are aligned with your business judgment.

For more details, please see [ML Assertions](<../../machine-learning/supervised/ml-assertions.html>)

#### Distributed Hyperparameters Search

It is now possible to distribute the training of a single model over multiple containers. Dataiku will automatically distribute all the points of the hyperparameter search. The distribution happens transparently, leveraging Kubernetes. No additional setup is required.

Distributed hyperparamter search permits vastly increased depth and precision of hyperparameter search while keeping an acceptable time for training.

#### Git push and pull for notebooks

It is now possible to fetch Jupyter notebooks from existing Git repositories, and to push them back to their origin. Pulls and pushes can be made notebook-per-notebook or for a group of notebooks.

For more details, please see [Importing Jupyter Notebooks from Git](<../../collaboration/import-notebooks-from-git.html>)

#### Wiki Export

Wikis can now be exported to PDF, either on a per-article basis or globally.

For more details, please see [Wikis](<../../collaboration/wiki.html>)

#### Model Fairness report

Evaluating the fairness of machine learning models has been a topic of both academic and business interest in recent years. Before prescribing any resolution to the problem of model bias, it is crucial to learn more about how biased a model is, by measuring some fairness metrics. The model fairness report provides you with assistance in this measurement task.

For. more details, please see [Model fairness report](<../../machine-learning/supervised/model-fairness-report.html>)

#### Streaming (experimental)

DSS now features an experimental real-time processing framework, notably targeting Kafka and Spark Structured Streaming.

For more details, please see [Streaming data](<../../streaming/index.html>)

#### Delta Lake reading (experimental)

DSS now features experimental support for directly reading the latest version of Delta Lake datasets.

For more details, please see [Delta Lake](<../../connecting/formats/deltalake.html>)

### Other notable enhancements

#### Azure Synapse support

DSS now officially supports Azure Synapse (dedicated SQL pools)

For more details, please see [Azure Synapse](<../../connecting/synapse.html>)

#### Date Preparation

DSS brings a lot of new capabilities for date preparation:

  * New visual prepare processors for incrementing or truncating dates, and for finding differences between dates

  * New ability to delete, keep or flag rows based on various time intervals

  * Better date filtering capabilities for Explore view




For more details, please see [Managing dates](<../../preparation/dates.html>)

#### Formula editor

The formula editor has been strongly enhanced with better code completion, inline help for all functions and features, and better examples.

For more details, please see [Formula language](<../../formula/index.html>)

#### Spark 3

DSS now supports Spark 3.

If using [Dataiku Cloud Stacks for AWS](<../../installation/cloudstacks-aws/index.html>) or [Elastic AI for Spark](<../../containers/index.html>), Spark 3 is builtin.

It is also now possible to use `SparkSession` in Pyspark code

#### Python 3.7

DSS now supports Python 3.7

You can now create Python 3.7 code envs. In addition, on Linux distributions where Python 3.7 is the default, DSS will automatically use it.

In addition, new DSS setups will now use Python 3.6 or Python 3.7 as the default builtin environment.

In Python 3.7, `async` is promoted to a reserved keyword and thus cannot be used as a keyword argument in a method or a function anymore. As a consequence, the DSS `Scenario` API is replacing the `async` keyword argument, formerly used in some methods, by the `asynchronous` keyword argument. Please make sure to update uses of the `Scenario` class accordingly if running Python scenarios or Python scenario steps with Python 3.7.

Impacted methods are: `run_scenario`, `run_step`, `build_dataset`, `build_folder`, `train_model`, `invalidate_dataset_cache`, `clear_dataset`, `clear_folder`, `run_dataset_checks`, `compute_dataset_metrics`, `synchronize_hive_metastore`, `update_from_hive_metastore`, `execute_sql`, `set_project_variables`, `set_global_variables`, `run_global_variables_update`, `create_jupyter_export`, `package_api_service`.

#### Builtin Snowflake driver

DSS now comes with the Snowflake JDBC driver and native Spark connector builtin. You do not need to install JDBC drivers for Snowflake anymore.

#### Enhanced “time-based” trigger

The time-based trigger in scenario has been strongly enhanced with the following capabilities:

  * Ability to show and handle triggering times in all timezones, not only server timezone

  * Ability to run every X hours instead of only every hour

  * Ability to run every X days instead of only every day

  * Ability to run every X week instead of only every week

  * Ability to run every X months instead of only every month

  * For once every X month triggers, ability to run on “last Monday” or “third Tuesday”

  * Ability to set a starting date for a trigger




#### Enhanced cross-connection and no-input SQL recipes

SQL recipes can now work without an input dataset. The recipe will run in the connection of the output dataset.

For SQL recipes with both inputs and outputs, it is now possible to enable “cross-connection” handling while using the connection of the output (previously, only inputs could be selected).

#### Addition of individual users to projects

You can now grant access to projects to individual users, in addition to groups.

#### Pan/Zoom control in Flow

You can now zoom and pan on the flow with the keyboard, and zoom and reset the zoom with dedicated buttons.

#### Variables expansion support in “Build”

The “Build” dialog now supports variables expansion for partitioned datasets

#### Variables expansion support in “Explicit values”

The “Explicit Values” partition dependency function now supports variables expansion

#### Schema reload and propagation as scenario steps

In many situations, it is expected that the schema of a Flow input dataset will change frequently, and that these changes should be accepted and their impacts propagated without further manual intervention.

In order to ease the situations, DSS 9 introduces two new scenario steps:

  * “Reload dataset schema” to reload the schema of an input dataset from the underlying data source

  * “Propagate schema” to perform an automated schema propagation across the Flow.




These steps should usually be used before a recursive Build step.

#### Experimental read support for kdb+

Dataiku now features experimental support for reading from [kdb+](<../../connecting/kdbplus.html>)

### Other enhancements and fixes

  * Snowflake: the JDBC driver and Spark connector are now preinstalled and do not need manual installation anymore

  * Snowflake: added post-connect statements

  * Snowflake: added support for Snowflake -> S3 fast-path when the target bucket mandates encryption

  * Vertica: fixed partitioning outside of the default schema

  * PostgreSQL: the builtin PostgreSQL has been updated to a more recent version, which notably fixes issues with importing tables on PostgreSQL 12

  * S3: It is now possible to force “path-style” rather than “virtualhost-style” S3 access. This is mainly useful for “S3-compatible” storages.

  * BigQuery: fixed ability to use “high throughput” mode for the JDBC driver




#### Flow

  * Added detection of changes in editable datasets, which will now properly trigger rebuilds

  * Fixed missing refresh of “Building” indicator with flow zones

  * Fixed wrong “current” flow zone remembered when browsing




#### Visual recipes

  * Prepare on Snowflake: fixed handling of accentuated column names

  * Fixed handling of “contains” formula operator on Impala when the string to match contains `_`

  * AKS: added ability to select the system node pool

  * Disabling an already-disabled Kubernetes-based API deployment will not fail anymore

  * Fixed webapps on Kubernetes leaking “Deployment” objects in Kubernetes

  * Fixed possible failures deploying webapps due to invalid Kubernetes labels

  * Fixed possible failures running Spark pipelines due to invalid Kubernetes labels

  * Added support for CUDA 11 when building base images

## [release_notes/semantic-models-lab]

# Semantic Models Lab Release notes

Semantic Models Lab provides the foundation for the [Semantic models feature](<../semantic-models/index.html>).

## Version 0.2.0 - Apr 3rd, 2026

Compatible with DSS 14.4.0 and above.

### New feature: Single dataset query tool

This new tool allows querying a single dataset, without having to build a complete semantic model first. The tool automatically builds a temporary semantic model on the fly.

### New feature: Simple execution

Both the Semantic Model Editor, Semantic Model query tool and Single dataset query tool can now either use either a simplified or full (agentic) orchestration methodology. Previous versions only supported the full orchestration.

Full orchestration provides better results for complex semantic models, but requires more back and forth with the LLM, which means that execution is overall slower. The simple orchestration provides good results in most cases, and is significantly faster.

### Querying

  * Both query tools now support propagating end-user identity to query the underlying databases

  * Generated SQL limits are now properly preserved when enforcing row caps

  * Multiple edge cases in configuration have been fixed




### Semantic Model Editor

  * The entity creation workflow has been reworked

  * Fixed issue with entity id normalization causing save failures

  * Multiple UI issues have been fixed in the editor




## Version 0.1.0 - Feb 9th, 2026

Initial release of Semantic Models Lab for DSS 14.4.0

  * **Improved tool call display** : Tool calls and their corresponding outputs are now displayed in a more readable format, even when streamed.

  * **Copy to clipboard** : You can now copy the content of any text-based inputs or outputs directly to your clipboard.

  * **Collapsible conversations** : Individual turns within a conversation trace can now be expanded and collapsed, making it easier to navigate long exchanges.

  * **Search in selected nodes** : A search bar has been added to the node explorer, allowing you to find specific text within the currently selected node.

  * **Quick navigation** : When the node explorer is in full-screen mode, you can now use quick navigation tools to help you navigate to the next available non-empty child or parent node.

  * **Tokens, cost and time per node** : The node explorer now displays key metrics for each node:
    
    * **Time** : Duration, and start and end times of the selected node.

    * **Token counts** : Prompt, completion and total counts.

    * **Estimated cost** : A cost estimation for the selected node.

  * **Accessibility Improvements** : To make node types easier to distinguish, the first letter of the node type is now displayed in the tree view and quick navigation menu.

  * **Handling of empty nodes** : Nodes without any data are now visually distinct. To streamline navigation, these empty nodes no longer open the node explorer, helping you focus on relevant data.

  * **Responsive full-screen view** : In full-screen mode, the node explorer’s panels are now arranged vertically for a better viewing experience. In the standard view, they are arranged horizontally.

  * **Trace detail panel repositioned** : The trace detail panel is now displayed on the right by default, preventing it from obscuring underlying graphs.

  * **Copy whole trace to clipboard** : This feature allows users to copy the currently selected trace to the clipboard.

  * **Reload button** : When reloading the traces list, traces were previously reset in the traces view but not in the trace history list. Both are now reset.

  * **Tab selection** : The trace history list bars on the left and right appeared black when a tab was selected. They are no longer black.

  * **Node panel** : Previously, when inspecting a node, the inspect panel would reappear (even after closing) if you went through an “empty view”. This no longer happens.




## Version 1.0.5 - Jul 4th 2025

### Bug Fix

  * **Traces list** : Fixed multiple bugs affecting the listing of the traces in the left panel.




## Version 1.0.4 - Jun 27th 2025
